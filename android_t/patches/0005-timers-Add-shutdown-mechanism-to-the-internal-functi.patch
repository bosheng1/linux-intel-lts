Subject: [PATCH 5/6] timers: Add shutdown mechanism to the internal functions

Tearing down timers which have circular dependencies to other
functionality, e.g. workqueues, where the timer can schedule work and work
can arm timers, is not trivial.

In those cases it is desired to shutdown the timer in a way which prevents
rearming of the timer. The mechanism to do so is to set timer->function to
NULL and use this as an indicator for the timer arming functions to ignore
the (re)arm request.

Add a shutdown argument to the relevant internal functions which makes the
actual deactivation code set timer->function to NULL which in turn prevents
rearming of the timer.
