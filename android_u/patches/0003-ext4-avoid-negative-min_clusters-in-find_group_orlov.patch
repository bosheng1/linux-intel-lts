Subject: [PATCH 3/5] ext4: avoid negative min_clusters in find_group_orlov()

[ Upstream commit bb0a12c3439b10d88412fd3102df5b9a6e3cd6dc ]

min_clusters is signed integer and will be converted to unsigned
integer when compared with unsigned number stats.free_clusters.
If min_clusters is negative, it will be converted to a huge unsigned
value in which case all groups may not meet the actual desired free
clusters.
Set negative min_clusters to 0 to avoid unexpected behavior.
